# String Calculator ‚Äî TDD Craftsmanship Kata

Welcome to my take on the classic **String Calculator Kata**, implemented as part of the **Incubyte Software Craftsperson recruitment process**.

This project is a demonstration of how powerful and elegant software can emerge through **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Every feature here has been carefully shaped using the red-green-refactor cycle, and every line of code is backed by tests that led its design.

| JavaScript | Core implementation language  |
| Node.js    | Runtime environment            |
| Jest       | Testing framework for JavaScript     |

## üß≠ Philosophy: TDD, Thought First

This project is not just a solution ‚Äî it‚Äôs a story of evolution.

Every test was written **before** implementation. The features grew **incrementally**, with confidence. I‚Äôve focused on **clarity, correctness, and continuous refactoring**, so that every piece of logic feels natural and intentional.

> üß† ‚ÄúTests don‚Äôt just verify code ‚Äî they inspire better design.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Test Cases

Each test below was written first, before any implementation, following the TDD workflow:  
**Fail ‚Üí Pass ‚Üí Refactor**
